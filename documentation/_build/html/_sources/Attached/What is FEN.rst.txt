Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)
==============================
Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game. The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position.

Definition
##########
A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. 
A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:

1. **Piece placement** *(from White's perspective)* Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1. Within each rank, each square is described from file (a-h). Each piece is identified by a single letter (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K"). White pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.
2. **Active color** "w" means White moves next, "b" means Black moves next.
3. **Castling availability** If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside). A move that temporarily prevents castling does not negate this notation.
4. **En passant** target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[2]
5. **Halfmove clock:** This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the fifty-move rule.
6. **Fullmove number:** The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
