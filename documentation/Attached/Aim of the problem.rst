This project is regarding the Chess. Before telling about the project let me introduce you to the game.
Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Played by millions of people worldwide.

This game has a set of rules to be followed.

Description
###########
In this project, I have written the code for displaying the FEN f the chess board just before the game ends. The input is given in a PGN file.

First the input is to be read from the file, and then different cases have to be handled and simultaneously moves should be made. 

Some cases like castling, en passant and special moves were critical which is looked upon in the code.

Input format
############
A text file having PGN notation

Output format
#############
A string of FEN notation

.. note::
    This is taken into the consideration that all the moves given in the FEN are valid.
